      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Brooke Spangler, and this is my portfolio where I will showcase some projects. I am 18 years old, and graduated high school last year, and am now a freshman at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. My high school experience consists of a beginner programming course, where I learned some python, as well as a Web Development class where I learned XHTML and CSS. Overall, I thoroughly I enjoy web development and developing websites to make them neat, organized, and high functioning. Below are two of my projects from this years CSET courses.</p>
